# solna-busyness-predictor
Parking in Solna (a commune in Stockholm, Sweden) is a challenge when there are popular events happening at Friends Arena. This app helps Solna residents relying on on-street parking to use this information to be better prepared.

## Why this project?
It solves a real problem for me - someone who depends on on-street parking being available when I need it. A bigger reason though is that I get to play around with **React SSR, Express and TypeScript** which I don't at work.

## So what's the solution?
1. A web scraper looks at events published on https://www.friendsarena.se/evenemang.
2. A smart (Eh..) algorithm predicts the likelihood of a shortage of on-street parking places based on a prediction of the demand for the upcoming events.
3. A notifier informs interested parties (residents of Solna, probably) via different channels (email, push notifications) relevant information about the calculated prediction for the forthcoming days.
